#Types of chords... Basically a dictionary structure
#Possibility of chord voicings below:
Chords = dict()
Chords['triad'] = [0,2,2]
Chords['triad7'] = [0,2,2,2]
Chords['triad7_o'] = [0,2,2,2,1]
Chords['power'] = [0,4]
#All of the triads
Triad = dict()
Triad['simple'] = [0,2,2]
Triad['alt1'] = [0,2,9]
Triad['alt2'] = [0, 2,16]
Triad['alt3'] = [0,4, 5]
Triad['alt4'] = [0,4,12]
Triad['alt5'] = [2,2,3]
Triad['alt6'] = [2,5,4]
Triad['alt7'] = [2,5,11]# more hre! :) :( :) :( :) :(

# all of the sevenths
Seventh = dict()
Seventh['simple'] = [0,2,2,2]

# Think hard about the chord constructions! :( :)
# also think more embelishments for 5 chords
#Wey! This page will basically have milllions of different chord generations that I would have to set
